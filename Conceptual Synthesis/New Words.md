Using a randomization seed, select two to three unrelated fields from any area of study or practice from an extensive list. Combine two to four Latin and Greek roots, along with optional prefixes and suffixes, to create 12 novel and unique words. Each word should reflect a coherent concept that integrates elements from these fields in a distinctive and inventive way. Ensure the words sound unique and memorable, while remaining practical. Provide a definition for each word, along with three example sentences demonstrating its use in different contexts.
